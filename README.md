# Deck of Cards

This program simulates a simple deck of cards. It contains two classes:
* **card** - each card has a rank and a suit. Ranks are numerical from 1 to 13, with 1 representing Aces, 11 representing Jacks, 12 representing Queens, and 13 representing Kings.

* **deck** - each deck has all 52 cards in a standard deck. The deck can be shuffled using the `shuffle!` method.
